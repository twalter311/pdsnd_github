Developed code using version of python embedded in the Udacity course

Some websites I used to aid in development:

stackoverflow.com for guidance

pandas.pydata.org for the pandas library and guidance

The previous sections of this Udacity course

The only code that is not unique to myself is the code that was present in the workspace when I started the project. I built my code around what was already present. 

REV A:

Post comments, I also used stack overflow and pandas again. Additionally, I used to provided template from the auditor to complete the missing step of code. 

REV B: 

Updated per comments regarding syntax

**Updating the file for staging and commitment**

Visited github, freecodecamp, and noble desktop to assist in creating branch

Added note to beginning of code to simulate changes
